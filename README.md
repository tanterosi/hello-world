# hello-world
Initially looking for help with an app only, I'd be happy if these first steps in Git would become my first steps on the way to coding.
Not sure if I'm committed enough to hang on to something that seems pretty hard work to me (because I might lack a talent for it). 
I love swimming, cats, dogs, donkeys, birds, hedgehogs, basically every animal, and am pretty much a sloth myself.
